# AdventOfCode2020

This repository will store my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code, I will be aiming to solve the tasks in Python, Java and ideally Haskell (learning, success tbc...).

I will have a separate folder for each language, with the goal of eventually having solutions to each one, in each language - this may vary depending on the complexity of challenges.

# Progress Tracker
- [ ] Day 1
  - [ ] Java

Came across this repo, which will have an accompanying YouTube series which appears to solve the challenges in Haskell (will likely be looking at this as a point of reference when solving challenges) - seems cool so worth having a look at: https://github.com/haskelling/aoc2020
